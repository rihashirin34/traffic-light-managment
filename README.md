🚦 Smart City Traffic Light Management System

A software-based traffic light management simulation designed for smart city applications.
This project dynamically controls traffic signals based on traffic density and provides priority handling for emergency vehicles, helping reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

🎯 Purpose

Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timers, which causes unnecessary waiting and congestion.
This project demonstrates how intelligent signal timing can optimize traffic movement at intersections.
